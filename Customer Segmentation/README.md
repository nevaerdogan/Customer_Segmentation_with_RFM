Methodology
RFM Analysis
RFM is a proven marketing analysis technique that segments customers based on three key dimensions:
R - Recency
How recently did the customer make a purchase?
Lower recency = More engaged customer
Scored from 1 (least recent) to 5 (most recent)

F - Frequency
How often does the customer make purchases?
Higher frequency = More loyal customer
Scored from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest)

M - Monetary
How much money does the customer spend?
Higher monetary value = More valuable customer
Scored from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest)
